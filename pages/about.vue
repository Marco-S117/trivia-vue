    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="mb-10">Hi, I'm Marco Polino, a junior web developer. I have always been passionate about the world of programming and in a relatively quiet period of my life (COVID-19) I decided to create this game to keep myself trained.</p>
    <h3>What is TriviaVue?</h3>
    <p>Trivia Vue is a simple web app that consists of a mini-game with questions. First you choose the options that will characterize the quiz, such as: amount, category, difficulty and type of questions, at this point you can start playing!</p>
    <h3>Start game</h3>
    <p>Once the game has started, there will be a countdown, which changes according to the difficulty chosen, within which to finish the game.</p>
    <h3>Game Over</h3>
    <p>The game can end in two ways, have answered all the questions or run out of time. In both cases, the ability to modify the answers given or to answer those not yet made will be blocked. Once the game is over, a summary window of the game just played will be opened and you will have the opportunity to show the result or even start a new game.</p>
